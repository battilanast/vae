The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to summarise theory and demonstrate the implementation of variational autoencoders, such that I should be able to use this as a VAE cheat sheet in a few months from now.

Note, download `VAE.ipynb` and run it locally in your Jupyter Notebook to ensure that the pictures are displayed properly.
